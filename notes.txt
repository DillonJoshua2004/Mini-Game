FINISHED:

1 - The player class is just a default of 10hp and 100mp, and they can onlt lose 1hp per hit against weak opponents, medium difficulty opponents cause 2hp damage, and hard opponents cause 4hp damage. BOSS opponents shall be separate

1.1 - need to work on an rng to determine how much damage the player does to the opponent
fundamentally it should be like this:
() - generate a random number from 0-18
() - anything from 0-5 means low damage (about 8% of the enemy's current hp)
() - anything from 6-11 means moderate damage (about 14% of the enemy's hp)
() - anything from 12-17 means high damage (about 18% of the enemy's hp)
() - 18 is a crit hit and does 50% damage to the enemy
these ranges may vary

1.2 - might make it so that any boss can one hit the player if a certain number (probably 69) is generated form the rng.

1.3 - the rng shall generate a number from the range 0-100:
() - 69 does the one hit
() - 0-50 shall just be 15% of the players hp, 51-79 (excluding 69) will do 30%, and anything 80 and above does 40%
() easy and medium bosses can do all 3 whereas hard bosses can only do heavy hits and the one hit, so the range for hard bosses shall be limited to 40-100, but to keep it fair the boss shall have a 40% chance of missing the attack (and the player also has the option to dodge an attack)


2 - need to work on a code to allow the player to regen hp -- code related

2.1 - and a code to allow the player to restart from checkpoints -- chucking the idea for another time

2.2 - and to do this i need to allow the player to choose when to start the next battle -- code related

2.3 - and also structure it so that it goes in 'rounds'. So the player can choose during defense to either heal or dodge, and heal is limited to a certain number of potions -- code related

2.4 - update: added the two health regen function to the battle function so that exactly when a battle ends the system calls those functions, and once the player has decided to heal or not, the game continues with their current hp.


3 - There should be any amount of opponents, but for now lets limit it to 14: 3 easy, 3 medium, 3 hard, and 5 bosses

4 - hp regen potion should restore 50% of "lost" hp (this may vary in the future): the player's health will not reset each battle, no need for a mana bar now (just leave it as mp: magic power). -- code related

5 - need to make changes to all functions related to damage -- code related

6 - decided not to write a story for this as it is a simple first project (game), so i will just make it a battle simulator (sort of). I will write a story for my next game once i have gained more knowledge related to images, etc in python.


7 - need to figure out how to access the code for the player's/enemy's/boss's health.

7.1 - then i need to store those values (excluding the player's health) in a 2d dictionary as we are facing multiple enemies and bosses.


8 - need to figure out a method calcualte the damage dealt between opponenets, and balance it out.

9 - need to figure out a method to reduce the number of lines of code while being able to choose who fights the player

10 - removed the boss_dmg function and just added it to the damage_received function

11 - created an inventory to store healing potions, created two functions: one for healing and the other once to decide whether they get a potion or not after a fight.
